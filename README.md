**** A modified ERC20 Token! ****

1) ERC20 with God Mode!
ERC20 with god-mode
God mode on an ERC20 token allows a special address to steal other people's funds, create tokens, and destroy tokens. Implement the following functions, they do what they sound like:

```
    mintTokensToAddress(address recipient)
    changeBalanceAtAddress(address target)
    authoritativeTransferFrom(address from, address to)
  ```
